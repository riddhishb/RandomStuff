// Vertex cover

/*
A vertex cover of an undirected graph is a subset of its vertices such that for every edge (u, v) of the graph, either ‘u’ or ‘v’ is in vertex cover.
Although the name is Vertex Cover, the set covers all edges of the given graph. 
Given an undirected graph, the vertex cover problem is to find minimum size vertex cover.
